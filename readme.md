## Judit Abell√≠ Technical Test

### Estructure
- Structure based on ITCSS architecture system, by Harry Roberts [(+ info)](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/)
Complemented with a [BEM-based nomenclature](http://getbem.com/).

- I've installed Gulp in order to compile and have Autoprefixr installed. Another option could have been install Webpack. 

### Personal Choices
- I've put a max-height at the img component in order to fit it in small screens (as my laptop). Otherwise, you have to scroll just for see some extra pixels and it's discusting. 

- I've create a mixin called "size" in order to translate px to rem. I used this for have the needed px defined in the mockup screens but also make it responsive to another resolutions.
